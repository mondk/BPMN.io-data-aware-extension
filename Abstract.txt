Extending BPMN.io towards the support of data-aware process modelling

Abstract. BPMN is a de facto modelling standard for business processes. In the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in extending BPMN towards the support of data management features such as data manipulation and data updates. In the existing literature, there are various proposals on such conceptual extensions, but none of such extensions have been fully realised in existing modeling tools. This work aims at developing a GUI extension for BPMN.io, (one of the leading BPMN modeling tools that is highly extensible, based on JavaScript and developed in Camunda), leveraging on a recently proposed BPMN-based formalism for data-aware processes, and a data modeling and manipulation language called PDMML. The extension will provide a set of features enabling users to seamlessly handle integrated modelling of data management components (volatile and persistent data object definitions as well as data manipulation expressions). Such features will be accessible in an integrated GUI component featuring syntax validation for PDMML that also takes into account contextual information such as persistent storage metadata. The developed extension will also suitably incorporate a previously implemented model checking prototype for parameterised verification of data-aware BPMN.
